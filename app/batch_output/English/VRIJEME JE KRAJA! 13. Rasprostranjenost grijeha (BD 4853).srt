1
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,150
I have prepared another Revelation for today.

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,500
So this is then the 13th lecture of the seminar Time is the End.

3
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,890
According to the new Booklet, and that 98 of the same name,

4
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,570
which will be the 14th in the series about the last times,

5
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,670
and that is the biggest series we have of Booklets, double more and even more

6
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:22,490
than, for example, the first creation and fall or the Gospel of love.

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,970
In this seminar, so from there and in the Booklet, for now there are two subtopics on the table.

8
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,470
One talks about what the Father intends to do

9
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:46,410
so that, just before the end, He would provide the possibility of salvation

10
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,450
to those who would otherwise be irretrievably lost,

11
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,870
because due to their pride, materialism and lust

12
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,290
they do not want to admit above Themselves a power to which they would submit

13
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,690
so that it would govern their lives.

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:18,830
So, that He will release the forces of nature in the world where such people live

15
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,370
with an intensity that has not been seen until now

16
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,770
and when their whole world will not only be collapsing

17
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:38,730
but when it will threaten, defeat them, terrify them

18
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,650
and a number of them will communicate with that Power

19
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,270
they will have enough intelligence to realize that this cannot be by chance

20
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,270
they will respond to the call and will call upon the Name of the Lord.

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,870
And if they do it from the heart, they will be delivered according to Acts 2:21.

22
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,550
That would be the first subtopic, we had it today the second lecture

23
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,970
of four planned on this my free day, which would be Monday.

24
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,430
And in this fourth sermon we switch to the other side

25
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,370
and on the other side or the second subtopic of this seminar

26
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,730
and that Booklet for now, is the state of people

27
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,370
which leads or brings to the end.

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,190
For me personally, as you have already heard several times,

29
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,790
that is the only necessary and sufficient sign to clearly see

30
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,370
that the end is near, that it cannot be avoided

31
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,570
and in which, end, is present the Father's greatest Love

32
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,070
because otherwise those souls, if they are not stopped by Divine intervention

33
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,690
and redirected though a painful path, which they themselves chose through matter,

34
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,550
again upwards, they would forever continue to fall.

35
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,670
Therefore, the spiritual state of people for me is a sufficient indicator,

36
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:22,170
a clear proof how much and why the end is near.

37
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,990
Well now, in this Revelation, this is newly translated, I have just translated it,

38
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,010
I have previously prepared and selected them.

39
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,450
In this Revelation, which is revelation 4853,

40
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,830
the Father will point out to us even the very essence of the problem.

41
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:53,290
By that, what it is that governs people to do what causes their downfall.

42
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,830
And the Revelation is called the spread of sin.

43
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,870
We have in 2 Peter 1:4, I will with this Revelation, this is not a big Revelation,

44
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,310
I will with this Revelation communicate to you also verses from the Scripture, as is proper,

45
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,750
this is not a big Revelation, otherwise there is not... two paragraphs in the receptions of Bertha Dudde,

46
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,230
it is always one Revelation, one sequence, but I have separated this for myself and you,

47
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,710
so it is easier for you to follow the thought.

48
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,530
In 2 Peter 1:4 we have a very important statement, and it says like this:

49
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:41,050
"having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of lust."

50
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,650
Because of what is corruption in the world?

51
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,270
By that.

52
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,430
Because of what is this world corrupted?

53
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,710
And if something is corrupted, then it is unusable and does not fulfill its purpose

54
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,410
and then it must be replaced.

55
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:09,970
I was recently forced to replace an old mixer, a stick one,

56
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,190
for a new one which is much better.

57
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,110
If for nothing else, then because it automatically turns off

58
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,910
when it overheats, which some people do not have enough feeling and

59
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,690
perception, to notice when they mix until it burns out.

60
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,090
Furthermore, that new mixer has something called silent mode,

61
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,710
and that means you can mix even while everyone is sleeping, they won't hear you.

62
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,450
And isn't that progress?

63
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,870
But in any case, that would be the old Earth and the new Earth,

64
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,550
old mixer, new mixer.

65
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:04,030
When my old mixer burned out, it no longer fulfilled its purpose,

66
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,990
it became unusable and had to be replaced

67
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,830
so that the purpose of me mixing would be fulfilled,

68
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,650
if not for myself,

69
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,430
then a smoothie for her every day, because that's usually how our day starts.

70
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,010
When she wakes up, we go make a smoothie, and a very quality one,

71
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,770
and then we go read the Bible for brave girls or currently I am.

72
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,090
Do we have picture and sound?

73
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:41,610
So, if you are wondering why the world as a device

74
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,790
which Lord God and our Father uses for mixing fallen beings

75
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:55,170
to make from them a smoothie, which would be edible for Him and drinkable,

76
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:02,610
why it broke down, you have the answer in 2 Peter 1:4.

77
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,110
where it says because of lust.

78
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,490
So, corruption is in the world because of lust.

79
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,470
What does that mean?

80
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:18,290
That means that bodily desires dominate people

81
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,850
thus their spiritual or inner man.

82
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,550
In a way that he is a slave to those bodily desires

83
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,450
and that he is subject to the body fulfilling each of them,

84
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,549
not denying it anything, not withholding from it,

85
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,590
but pleasing it and allowing it,

86
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,250
and thus also himself on that level, to enjoy in that.

87
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,150
That is the reason why the world will perish,

88
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,160
and that means almost everyone. Are you with me?

89
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,980
And to be honest, most of you present here

90
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,340
contribute to that, because your lives are like that too,

91
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,120
and your bellies testify to that.

92
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,440
You can freely say amen.

93
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,860
And since I'm already here, I hope you won't mind,

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,480
it also comes to my mind, since we're already in the introductory word,

95
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,560
a famous package of verses, that you more or less know,

96
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,560
because I often quote it,

97
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,480
Colossians 3:5, but also six.

98
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Listen, when it says put to death therefore your earthly members,

99
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,220
that is the opposite of what I said,

100
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,820
that causes corruption in this world,

101
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,920
so the world, the broken mixer, will have to be replaced

102
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,860
for a new, better mixer, called new Heaven, new Earth,

103
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,180
because it is unusable, and a mixer is needed,

104
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,040
unusable, does not fulfill the purpose,

105
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,860
and then it needs to be replaced, because this one is unrepairable.

106
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,280
This Earth and people are unrepairable.

107
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,020
And then it says, this is the opposite,

108
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,940
and therefore if you do not do this, you contribute

109
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,940
to the fact that the end is coming, and that end will be disastrous for you,

110
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,960
if you are like that.

111
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,300
Put to death, therefore, your earthly members,

112
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,120
fornication, impurity, passions,

113
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,200
evil lust and greed, that is also idolatry.

114
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,860
So, the first four are bodily lusts,

115
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,840
greed is a soul disease,

116
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,840
but it also manifests on the bodily level,

117
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,340
because someone can be greedy for food.

118
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,410
And according to that you see what kind of man is in the body,

119
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,470
that he has sin in the body, Romans 7,

120
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,530
and if he does not apply Christ's grace and strength

121
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,510
to mortify his bodily or earthly members,

122
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,450
sin from there, through fornication, impurity,

123
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,710
passion, evil desire and greed, will overcome him

124
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,570
and he will live an unspiritual, natural, material life

125
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,470
in which he will satisfy the body fulfilling its desires appetites and lusts

126
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,770
and in this way spiritually dead under the power of Satan he goes into the abyss.

127
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,350
And since such are the majority, that's why the world is perishing.

128
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,550
Now look, we mention this often, but that's not why I came.

129
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,050
I came because of the sixth verse, and the sixth verse says,

130
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,950
just to find it, I opened several Bibles,

131
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,070
in the sixth verse it says,

132
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,790
because of this comes the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.

133
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:13,070
The wrath of God here is nothing else but the judgment of God, the punishment of God.

134
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,170
So, if you wonder why the wrath of God

135
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,670
and the judgment of God will befall people, that's because of the aforementioned.

136
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,630
Do we have picture and sound? To be honest, I was on the scale,

137
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,830
but it tipped because I followed the guidance, I'm talking about marital fellowship,

138
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,350
and the next seminar, after we finished "Booklet number 57,

139
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,330
the first three Revelations", I chose, if you listened, you heard the continuation,

140
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,790
because we will work on Divine Love, that is taught in church,

141
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,010
and then, but it hangs there, stands in the air,

142
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,310
the continuation also, Booklet number 57,

143
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,870
will be called, that's also "Booklet number 57,

144
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,350
bodily lust must be sacrificed".

145
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,310
That's what it will be called. Bodily lust must be sacrificed.

146
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,790
You know, if you want to live a Divine spiritual way of life,

147
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,650
this bodily lust... I see the need for people to understand this,

148
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,750
because I see for them it's just the body,

149
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,090
or just lust, they don't have an overview of the situation.

150
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,350
That's why it will be called "Booklet number 57,

151
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,350
- bodily lust", in capital letters,

152
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,950
MUST, and again the continuation small," be sacrificed".

153
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,670
Otherwise that sentence is approximately in the Revelation we first covered at this seminar,

154
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,530
3310, Love... Divine... perverted between two people.

155
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,310
And then it says, bodily love must be sacrificed, to the spiritual.

156
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,050
But the sentence I received, which I heard in my spirit,

157
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,750
not audibly, but as a distinct thought that jumped out,

158
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,870
is bodily lust must be sacrificed.

159
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,550
OK, that's also in the topic.

160
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,450
Now let's go to the Revelation from which I believe you will not sleep peacefully,

161
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,350
but that's all right, because if you can't sleep,

162
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,770
that means you have an unclean conscience and you will need to repent.

163
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,390
That's all right, night is an excellent period of time for that,

164
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,870
because usually the noise of the city and the music of your,

165
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:40,660
I don't know, from YouTube from your phone, music on your channel,

166
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,740
or usually people around you are sleeping,

167
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,160
usually you are like sleeping, so people are silent and you can hear yourself,

168
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,080
so I don't have much compassion and mercy for that

169
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,740
if you don't sleep, I only pray that you use it.

170
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,880
Did someone here write down that we commented on

171
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,500
2 Peter 1:4. Colossians 3 verses 5 and 6.

172
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Write it down so you don't look at me later as if I fell from Mars.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,960
So, Revelation 4853 The Spread of Sin.

174
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,800
The Father says this way, you know that the first sentence is of great importance,

175
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,520
because it determines the direction of the whole Revelation and of course shows us the goal

176
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,500
which we should achieve, about which in the last sentence.

177
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,640
That is the rule of the first and last sentence and praised be Jesus

178
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,880
that it was revealed to Swedenborg.

179
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,180
Sin will prevail and people will live in lust

180
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,260
and sin without a sense of responsibility,

181
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,760
because Satan rules the world and people are in slavery to him.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,960
So, this is obvious.

183
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,820
Obvious.

184
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,800
Especially it is obvious, but I ask you to try to understand.

185
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,100
When it is spoken about lust of the body,

186
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,880
usually it is meant sexual lust, it is part of the package,

187
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,020
but the problem is much deeper.

188
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,100
You know, it is about satisfying that which

189
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,100
the body is made of, and that is the Satanic spirit under judgment,

190
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:36,220
who in that way rules or continues to rule over the spiritual man.

191
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
Whereby this one is in slavery to Pharaoh the king of Egypt

192
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,480
and is spiritually dead.

193
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:50,740
That state of spiritual death is a missed earthly life

194
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,520
and leads to spiritual ruin.

195
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,120
You know, that is much worse.

196
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,960
You must understand what is happening

197
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
at the moment of fulfilling every bodily desire,

198
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,420
even sexual desire.

199
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,839
You know.

200
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,060
I don't know why you are looking at me.

201
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:38,280
In Proverbs 7:18. but we can also Ecclesiastes 2:1.

202
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,820
Here it speaks about the adulterous woman whose husband went on a journey.

203
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,360
We spoke about that also with Samson.

204
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,880
And a young man of little sense fell under her charms.

205
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,240
She says, come let us get drunk with pleasure until morning

206
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,000
and let us rejoice in the delights of love.

207
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,260
So, to get drunk with pleasure.

208
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,880
A man is in that state intoxicated as far as the spiritual man is concerned,

209
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,800
because bodily pleasure or delight controls his sound mind.

210
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,640
You know.

211
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,300
That must be sacrificed.

212
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,440
And you must understand that in essence,

213
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,480
in order to see where it all shows its ugly snake head.

214
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,860
That will be a seminar on Marriage once I finish

215
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,500
after 100 lectures of this according to Booklet 21.

216
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,780
But Jesus will somehow give me time.

217
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,500
You see that He is cloning me, that I am getting better and better.

218
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,180
And then we have in Ecclesiastes 2:1.

219
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,440
"Then I said in my heart,

220
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,800
let me try pleasure and see what delight provides.

221
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,210
But behold, this also is vanity.

222
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,650
Of laughter I said it is madness, of pleasure what is the use."

223
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,730
And see the second verse.

224
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,870
So, this is quite important to understand what is happening here.

225
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,490
There is pleasure that intoxicates so that you do not think with your spiritual head.

226
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,510
And in that state Satan is your master.

227
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,470
He rules, that state is his child.

228
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:28,290
And so, blinded because of your wrong love, he leads you to ruin.

229
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:35,450
And you do not see the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God.

230
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:44,950
Because if you saw, then for you this would apply in Psalm 119:47 and 77.

231
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,110
And he says: "In Your commandments is my delight because I love them."

232
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,910
And below it says: "For Your law is my delight."

233
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,530
These are two opposite delights.

234
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,110
And again the first sentence in Revelation 4853.

235
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,610
It says sin will prevail, that is the state in the world,

236
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,110
and people will live in lust and sin without a sense of responsibility.

237
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,480
You see for example that young people are completely lost in space and time.

238
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,980
And I will tell you exactly why that is.

239
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,160
And you unfortunately, since you are of little spiritual sense,

240
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,320
you cannot conclude that yourselves.

241
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,060
Otherwise you would be holding sermons and your voice would be heard far away,

242
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,960
because you couldn't watch that, because you would see that behind that is ruin.

243
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,660
This is how the situation goes for you.

244
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,400
The notorious puberty, when children break free from control

245
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,360
and what parents fear like a nightmare,

246
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,320
is nothing else but sexuality begins to awaken

247
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,580
in the body of a man, a young person and a woman,

248
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,520
which drives them to fulfill their purpose on that level,

249
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,860
because mostly then they are not at all spiritual,

250
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,280
and that is the natural and soul level.

251
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,820
That is an extremely strong drive.

252
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,080
You know? And there they resist authority and framework,

253
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,080
because it limits them in that.

254
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,000
Are you with me?

255
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,020
And now in that state, because often parents unsuccessfully,

256
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,320
fulfill their role of Christ in the family,

257
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,020
so they prepare the children for life, with word and deed and example.

258
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,940
And then in today's time, where all sorts of things are imposed on them,

259
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,860
and parents are to blame because they let them watch all kinds of craziness,

260
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,040
which then become authority for them and those influence them,

261
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,080
then we have this about which we read in Romans,

262
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,660
we will read only the part about perverted sexuality,

263
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,660
but of course it says at the end that it deserves death.

264
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,040
And it says that they, claiming to be wise Romans 1:22, became fools,

265
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,920
they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the image in the likeness of corruptible man

266
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,240
and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles,

267
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,440
and therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity,

268
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,340
so they dishonor their own bodies,

269
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,020
which should be the temple of the Holy Spirit and that is punishable.

270
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,300
Those who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, worshiped and served the creature

271
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,500
instead of the Creator, we read further down from verse 22 of the first chapter of Romans,

272
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,560
calls them foolish people, they think they are the smartest,

273
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,120
and worshiped and served the creature instead of the Creator

274
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,340
who is blessed forever amen.

275
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,160
And therefore God gave them up, here it is, to shameful passions.

276
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,660
And their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural,

277
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,620
and so also men abandoned natural intercourse with a woman

278
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,280
and burned with lust for one another,

279
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,420
so men with men do shameful things

280
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,420
and themselves receive in themselves the due penalty of their error.

281
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,300
Notice that it is about inflamed lust.

282
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,980
That lust is inflamed at an early age,

283
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,040
especially today among young people, and nothing else drives them.

284
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,800
Now, if they are not properly taught, there is the root of the problem.

285
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,920
Because sexuality is very important, but also very strong.

286
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,640
And then, that is the driver.

287
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,780
And with perversion, which is in the world, they very easily perish,

288
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:55,440
and perversion is obvious in the world because the world is corrupted because of lust.

289
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,400
Above all sexual lust. That guides people above all.

290
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,420
Revelation 1021, second paragraph, that is the natural law,

291
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,660
that is the love which drives us to unite, but on the lowest level.

292
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,520
It drives animalistically, because people on that level are worse than animals.

293
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,880
And then, because of that lust, that is the train of thought, you can clearly follow that,

294
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,060
and as they were not worthy to hold to the knowledge of God,

295
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,760
God gave them over to a debased mind so that they do what is not fitting.

296
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,760
But these are people who are just described, who have sexually strayed.

297
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,920
And then, because of that, they are full of all unrighteousness, malice, greed, evil,

298
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,600
full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice.

299
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Because of that is the corruption, which he now describes, because of lust, which he described before.

300
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,040
Malice, whisperers, deceit, slanderers, haters of God, insolent,

301
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,060
drunkards, usurpers, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,

302
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,980
unreasonable, unfaithful, heartless, merciless, they know God's decree

303
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,500
that those who do such things deserve death, and they not only do them,

304
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,380
but also approve of those who do them. I know such people, they approve of it for their children,

305
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,160
but their punishment will not be late.

306
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,300
You know, you have in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 10,

307
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,560
and in Galatians 5:19-21, you have the works of the flesh,

308
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,460
and again a good part of that, is carnal lust,

309
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,160
such will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

310
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Therefore carnal lust and pleasure must be sacrificed.

311
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,240
Are you with me. But as the world is not able because it is too far gone,

312
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,460
that is the reason for its downfall.

313
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,020
So here, once again the first sentence, then we go to Revelation,

314
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,720
because I could now explain the Bible to you with this view,

315
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,500
from Genesis to Revelation, but then that would divert the sermon in another direction.

316
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,260
Sin will prevail and people will live in lust and sin.

317
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,100
This is a prophetic word that covers the situation, which we clearly see.

318
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,060
This was March 7th, 50. Without a sense of responsibility.

319
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,620
They don't think they will be accountable, but it says below that they will.

320
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,280
They don't think, I look them in the eyes, they don't think they will be accountable.

321
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,700
You know, they are so blinded,

322
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,080
so intoxicated, so succumbed to the adversary, that they don't think they will be accountable.

323
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,900
And then it says, without a sense of responsibility, because Satan rules the world.

324
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
Jesus Christ does not rule, Satan.

325
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,960
Jesus rules only where his own have allowed him to rule through them.

326
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,380
But the world is under the power of Satan.

327
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,320
2 Corinthians 4:3 and 4, Luke 4:5-8.

328
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,400
And people are in his bondage.

329
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,200
Period.

330
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,900
That is the reason for Revelation.

331
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,800
And then it says, and they gladly follow his whispers, or his urgings,

332
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,600
weakly and without resistance they succumb to his temptations,

333
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,080
as they fulfill carnal desires.

334
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,260
"Booklet number 57-carnal desire must be sacrificed"

335
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:38,620
is the seminar that follows when one fine day we close the seminar I announced,

336
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,800
"Serious warnings regarding Christian love for one's neighbor".

337
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,940
Where I will go into the depth of this problem, because I see only shallowness around me.

338
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,640
And watch out.

339
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,460
And it says, they succumb to his temptations fulfilling carnal desires

340
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,640
and have no disgust towards anything.

341
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,730
Or revulsion, repulsion.

342
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,080
While anyone normal should feel disgust towards that.

343
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,120
You know.

344
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,460
Good.

345
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,280
Sin lures them and so people sink into their own mud.

346
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Ok. And now, because of that, period, next thought.

347
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,260
The end is near.

348
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,760
Why? Well, that mixer has burned out.

349
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,080
It does not fulfill its purpose, it is unusable and a new mixer is needed.

350
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,940
That new mixer is called Heaven new Earth.

351
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,780
The end is near.

352
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,100
Anyone who pays attention to the behavior of people,

353
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,680
that would be me, because I really like to observe people,

354
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,840
not to hold it against them, but to see their quality,

355
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,760
to see in relation to the Divine goal and arrangement,

356
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,260
in what relative state and possession they are, because that is my occupation.

357
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,460
Anyone who pays attention to the behavior of people,

358
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,280
also knows what hour has struck.

359
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,160
That the Earth is ripe for destruction.

360
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,880
So, I don't have to look at anything else,

361
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,920
to listen only to the state among people, because of the state in people.

362
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,700
I know when I see that, and I see what time has struck.

363
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,460
And that the Earth is ripe for destruction.

364
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,200
And that people, very important, because everything I say about the state of people

365
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,230
refers to what I will now say,

366
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,260
because I think like that, because that is correct thinking,

367
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,580
and that is in relation to purpose.

368
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,100
If your life does not fulfill the purpose,

369
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,180
your on Earth, your life on Earth has no purpose.

370
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Let's start from the beginning.

371
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,060
If your life on Earth does not fulfill the purpose,

372
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,820
your life on Earth has no purpose.

373
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,040
And then it says,

374
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,320
and that people forget their purpose of life on Earth

375
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,900
and so they stand before the abyss.

376
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,300
So, they balance on the edge of the abyss.

377
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,740
And that is almost all people in the world.

378
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,380
Do not let charismatic gatherings deceive you.

379
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,480
And there too, almost all are like that.

380
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,440
You know, that the Spirit hits them,

381
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,440
that changes them very little.

382
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,020
They are not ready for change, you know.

383
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,920
I don't know why you look at me as if you have never been to a charismatic gathering,

384
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,060
well, you are one of those too.

385
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,800
Did the Spirit, when it laid you on the floor, did it change you?

386
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,380
Of course it did not.

387
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,860
And look, this is a very important sentence,

388
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,180
so we will go back to repeat.

389
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,700
The end is approaching.

390
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,200
Everyone who pays attention,

391
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,380
and should first to themselves, then to people around them,

392
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,760
to the behavior of people,

393
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,980
also knows, does not think,

394
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,140
knows what time has struck.

395
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,360
And that the Earth is ripe for destruction

396
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,540
and that people forget their purpose of life on Earth,

397
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,240
and so, I would say, and therefore they stand before the abyss.

398
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,340
Now, in that state, that is not written, that is written between the lines,

399
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,160
Satan has them completely under his control

400
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,660
and they no longer offer him any resistance.

401
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,040
They acknowledge him as their master

402
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,660
and do what he asks of them.

403
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,000
Now, those people do not think so.

404
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:49,200
So, when we fulfill the desires, lusts and appetites of our body,

405
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,940
those are all people who eat three meals a day.

406
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:07,490
You know, those people thereby destroy their spiritual life.

407
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,890
I mean, gluttony and lust are two mortal sins,

408
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,050
so that is nothing new, only people do not know how to connect that with themselves.

409
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,470
You know, maybe they know how to sing songs about the seven deadly sins,

410
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,490
if that exists, maybe there is some rap,

411
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,290
but they cannot connect that with themselves.

412
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,950
We love you, Jesus!

413
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,030
And then they think that none of it concerns them.

414
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,030
If you are that one, that is what Satan wants from you

415
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,950
and by that way he destroys your spiritual life.

416
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,050
And as the majority are like that,

417
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,950
the Earth and the life of people on Earth does not fulfill the purpose

418
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,630
and therefore the end comes,

419
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,610
because that then means destruction of the old, creation of the new,

420
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,810
and then from the beginning.

421
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,210
In sin people will suffocate,

422
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,070
in sin they will perish,

423
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,710
because in the midst of enjoying life

424
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,090
they will find their end as it is written.

425
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,889
It is written when it says it will be like the days of Noah,

426
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,830
because they ate, drank, married, were given in marriage, bought, sold.

427
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,790
And all that until the day when Noah entered the ark,

428
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,949
here Matthew 24, verses 37-39,

429
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,650
we love you Jesus, we can open that here,

430
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,070
just before we also read,

431
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,469
until Noah entered the ark,

432
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,250
and then the flood came and took them all.

433
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,550
And took them all.

434
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,370
And they suspected nothing.

435
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,050
They lived normally.

436
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,969
And we have of course also Revelations on the topic,

437
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,290
just like in the days of Noah,

438
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,530
where it then speaks about how people will enjoy,

439
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,950
give themselves to lusts and pleasures,

440
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,530
and will not care for their spiritual life,

441
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,990
for the purpose of their life.

442
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,710
Alright, just so you know,

443
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,530
if you are among such,

444
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,430
who governs you, what drives you

445
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,710
and where you will end up.

446
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,450
And then it says, well now,

447
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,370
regarding that situation,

448
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,110
it does not seem hard to see this, to understand,

449
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,230
that is why He reveals Himself.

450
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,670
And that is my holy and honorable role

451
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,050
as the one who proclaims this truth.

452
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,950
And I do that regularly,

453
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,990
that is one stream within the Body of the Mission,

454
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,550
it is dedicated to the last days,

455
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,270
that is why the page, now a new look for that page is coming,

456
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,670
so www.ljubavsohladla.com,

457
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,790
that is why almost 600 translated Revelations,

458
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,090
many seminars,

459
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,030
13th, now soon 14th. Library,

460
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,710
now also little videos and picture books,

461
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,650
that is very, very important for you

462
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,890
and the whole world.

463
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,970
And that is why I invite people,

464
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,750
and now someone has to do that out loud,

465
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,370
and that is why I invite people,

466
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,650
that one day all of you will have to answer

467
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:19,450
for your thoughts, deeds and words.

468
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,170
All of you will be judged

469
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,370
according to your will and your deeds.

470
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,550
Because Jesus says, let's say,

471
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,170
if you will like that in Revelation 22:12.

472
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,630
that behold, I am coming soon,

473
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,390
and with me is the reward to give to all

474
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,670
according to his deeds.

475
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,390
When the books of life will be opened,

476
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:45,890
Revelation 21, verses 11 and 12,

477
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,210
now we will open that too,

478
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,160
20, verses 11 and 12, pardon, 20,

479
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,340
and I saw a great white throne

480
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,880
and the One who sat on it,

481
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,680
before His face fled,

482
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,060
the earth and the heaven,

483
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,780
and no place was found for them anymore,

484
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,800
and I saw the dead, great and small,

485
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,520
standing before the throne,

486
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,080
and a book, books were opened,

487
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,080
another book was opened,

488
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,160
the book of life,

489
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,620
and the dead were judged

490
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,220
by what is written in the books,

491
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,420
by their deeds.

492
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,980
Verse 13, the sea gave up its dead,

493
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,700
and death and the underworld theirs,

494
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,060
and each was judged by their deeds.

495
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,980
Second Corinthians 5:10 says

496
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,800
that we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ,

497
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,020
and answer for what we have done in the body,

498
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,100
whether good or evil,

499
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,080
and we should live with that in mind,

500
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,980
and judge our deeds, thoughts,

501
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,260
in relation to the Word of God,

502
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,560
which reveals His will,

503
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,140
and what He considers sin,

504
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,120
and we should consider sin,

505
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,380
and then therefore repent,

506
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,400
and reject, and do it no more,

507
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,700
otherwise we will suffer loss.

508
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Do not fall into sin, it says,

509
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,800
keep yourselves pure,

510
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,880
and despise evil.

511
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,060
That sin does not become

512
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
your downfall.

513
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,260
That it does not drag you

514
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,300
into the abyss. So, what will drag people

515
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,240
into the abyss, is sin.

516
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,100
Now then, people

517
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,080
think they are not

518
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,920
sinners, because they have not

519
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,060
killed anyone, and because

520
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,780
they go to church.

521
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,080
It is commendable, if they have not

522
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,960
killed anyone, and even

523
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,800
more commendable, if they go to a living

524
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,700
church, but there are not many of those.

525
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,060
But if

526
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,960
they have not killed anyone,

527
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,640
and go to church,

528
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,960
but are led by

529
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,180
the flesh, they are constantly

530
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,990
in sin, and their

531
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,700
destiny is spiritual death.

532
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,060
And I will show you that now,

533
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,200
and that in three packages of verses.

534
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,120
I will show you

535
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,020
first where it is clearly written,

536
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,260
James 1,

537
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,140
and those verses

538
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,380
14,

539
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,840
we can

540
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,380
13-15, let no one in

541
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,560
to tempt, let no one say God is tempting me,

542
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,900
for God cannot be tempted

543
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,980
by evil, and he tempts no one,

544
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,380
but each one is tempted,

545
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,940
or tested by his own desire,

546
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,920
which draws him and entices him notice,

547
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,220
desire then having conceived

548
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,460
gives birth to sin,

549
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,840
and sin when it is full-grown gives birth

550
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,780
to death. So,

551
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,820
even though they maybe have not

552
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,800
killed anyone, spiritually surely

553
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,060
they have,

554
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,940
and they go to church, and are still spiritually dead,

555
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,680
and go to ruin. If

556
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,860
they indulge the desires

557
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,620
of their flesh, because

558
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,020
no one who lives according to the flesh, will

559
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,280
see life,

560
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,580
that is clearly written in Romans 8:13

561
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,740
where we read, for

562
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,600
if you live according to the flesh, you must die,

563
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,920
but if by the Spirit you put to death

564
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,040
the deeds of the body, you will live.

565
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,000
And we also have Galatians

566
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,980
6:8, and we will open that.

567
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,260
Indeed whoever sows to his flesh

568
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,020
from the flesh will reap

569
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,120
corruption, that means he will perish,

570
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,700
but whoever sows to the Spirit,

571
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,660
from the Spirit will reap eternal life,

572
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
and that is again life and death.

573
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,740
And so I will hold

574
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,960
a seminar, so you see what this is really

575
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,980
about in the day,

576
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,060
when you are led

577
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,200
by the flesh, when by the Spirit, Galatians

578
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,300
5:16 and 17,

579
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
when you are in grace, when under the law,

580
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,820
the whole context of Romans 8,

581
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,180
and where will not lead you

582
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,940
the works of the flesh, that is into the Kingdom,

583
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,940
and how by the fruits

584
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,000
not of the Spirit in you it is seen that you live

585
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,720
by the flesh. Is that a good plan?

586
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,940
Because it says those who are Christ's,

587
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,160
Galatians 5:24, have crucified

588
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,240
their flesh with its passions and desires,

589
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,040
when the flesh is crucified,

590
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,840
it no longer lives, and then you have

591
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,380
overcome and live by the Spirit.

592
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
As almost no one lives by the Spirit,

593
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,000
it is clear that he lives by the flesh, whoever lives

594
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,140
by the flesh, is spiritually dead and cannot

595
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,080
enter the Kingdom, and so the world

596
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,980
perishes, because such a life

597
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,900
by the flesh, absolutely

598
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,580
does not fulfill its purpose,

599
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,880
and thus

600
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
becomes purposeless on Earth.

601
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,810
Do not fall into sin,

602
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,630
keep yourselves pure and

603
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,630
despise evil, so that sin does not

604
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,550
become your ruin, so that it does not

605
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,230
drag you into the abyss.

606
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,530
Do not dull

607
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,650
the admonisher within you,

608
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,730
listen to the voice

609
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,530
of conscience, which

610
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,830
warns you about every

611
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,910
bad thought and every

612
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,750
bad deed. You now know

613
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,770
after two seminars,

614
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,510
the bigger and the smaller,

615
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,530
that there is Booklet number 67

616
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,830
voice of the heart, where we have one chapter

617
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,030
about the voice of conscience,

618
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,730
and if you haven't already, it would be good

619
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,590
to have that Booklet on your night

620
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,750
table, because that is your fundamental Booklet

621
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,570
just like the seminar.

622
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,570
Pay attention to its

623
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,350
voice of admonisher

624
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,890
or voice of conscience and follow it.

625
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,850
Do not easily

626
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,650
ignore sin, like well

627
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,650
everyone sins or it's not that terrible?

628
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,670
That would be easy to ignore

629
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,000
sin. Well, here, it is terrible,

630
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,300
the end of the world is coming, that seems to me quite terrible,

631
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,900
because that means the ruin

632
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,510
of many people. Let's do it like this,

633
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,570
the world will perish,

634
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,130
because bodily lust

635
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,030
was not sacrificed

636
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,790
for the sake of spiritual

637
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,390
aspiration.

638
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,750
And then it says,

639
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,490
pay

640
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,490
attention to its voice

641
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,370
of admonisher and follow it.

642
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,370
Do not easily ignore

643
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,570
sin, but remember the One

644
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,710
who will one day judge you.

645
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,390
And we do not like

646
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,310
that word, but still that is

647
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,290
a valid word. Those are

648
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,510
the foundations of Christianity.

649
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,650
And that is the eternal judgment.

650
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,210
One of six

651
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,930
characteristics

652
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,570
of the fundamental doctrine

653
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,030
is judgment.

654
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,630
Judgment.

655
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,610
Those are

656
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,210
Hebrews 6:1 and 2.

657
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,550
We love you Jesus.

658
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,710
And therefore, I think,

659
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,630
it would be good to sometimes mention

660
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,110
judgment.

661
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,610
And that says

662
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,490
eternal judgment.

663
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,050
In Hebrews 6:2.

664
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,690
Eternal judgment.

665
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,190
Therefore judgment is a valid

666
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,230
word. We must live

667
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,010
with an eye on judgment, because we will

668
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,690
be judged by righteousness.

669
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,910
No matter how much

670
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,190
grace is offered to us, we will

671
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,170
be judged by righteousness.

672
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,550
Acts 17:31.

673
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,910
A day is appointed when He will

674
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,050
judge by Christ Jesus by righteousness

675
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,090
people. And then it says

676
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,070
and

677
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,350
pay attention to His voice

678
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,970
and follow Him. Do not easily

679
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,030
ignore sin, but

680
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,110
remember the One who will one day

681
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,230
judge you, who is righteous

682
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,150
and punishes every

683
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,230
sin, because sin

684
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,790
requires compensation

685
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,050
or rather atonement.

686
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:13,990
If you

687
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,150
live outside of grace, because

688
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,230
you live by the flesh,

689
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,680
there is no atonement

690
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,340
for sin through Christ Jesus.

691
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,500
Therefore everything

692
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,660
you must atone for yourself, suffer

693
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,080
and that is the punishment for sin.

694
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,780
Are you with me?

695
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,000
Ok.

696
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,040
That awaits

697
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,100
all apostates

698
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,420
from Christ.

699
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,620
That is also in

700
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,300
Hebrews, so we can

701
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,180
read in the sixth chapter,

702
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,760
because that is the same

703
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,200
thought.

704
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,140
Because it says

705
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,360
who were once enlightened tasted the heavenly gift

706
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,000
became partakers of the Holy Spirit,

707
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,380
tasted the good Word of God, this is the good Word of God

708
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,200
and the powers of the coming world, which is the power

709
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,480
of the Spirit and the gifts, and then fell away.

710
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,960
It is impossible again

711
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,200
to renew to repentance. When they themselves

712
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,040
again crucify the Son of God,

713
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,080
because they expose Him to ridicule, there is nothing

714
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,040
then of the sacrifice on the cross. And then likewise

715
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,180
we love

716
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,840
you Jesus,

717
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,260
in Hebrews chapter 10,

718
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,180
when it says,

719
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,200
for if willfully 26th

720
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,560
verse, we sin after we have received

721
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,280
knowledge of the truth, there is no more

722
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,100
sacrifice for sins but a fearful

723
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,060
expectation of judgment and wrath,

724
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,240
of fire that will devour

725
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,940
the adversaries. I held a KVP

726
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,980
lecture on the topic that the New Testament

727
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,060
of course has better promises and

728
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,340
it is a better covenant, but it also has a more fearful

729
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,040
punishment. So I

730
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,280
commented on these verses,

731
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,780
because it says, imagine how much

732
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,900
worse punishment than the people

733
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,960
of the Old Testament, and they were executed

734
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,820
on the basis of two or three witnesses,

735
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,860
will deserve the one who tramples the Son of God

736
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,720
and considers unclean the blood of the covenant

737
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,980
by which he was sanctified and the spirit of grace

738
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,000
insults. Who are those? Well, those who go to church,

739
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,160
hear the truth about what is sin and then sin.

740
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,960
Do you know that they don't think

741
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,100
that they are bad people.

742
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,240
They are

743
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,580
servants

744
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,280
of Satan and spiritually dead people

745
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,780
and for them is fire.

746
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,860
That the scripture

747
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,840
says. And now it is necessary to reach them

748
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,940
to save them.

749
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,660
They don't think they need

750
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,860
salvation because they haven't killed anyone and go to church.

751
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,040
You see how

752
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,500
the situation is complicated.

753
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
And then it says,

754
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,720
pay attention to his voice

755
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,680
and follow it, the voice

756
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,520
of conscience, the voice of the admonisher,

757
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,600
which is the voice of Christ.

758
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,520
Do not easily ignore sin, but remember the One

759
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,140
who will one day judge you,

760
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,560
who is just and punishes every sin,

761
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,520
because sin requires compensation or

762
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,260
atonement.

763
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,300
Do not allow yourselves to be tempted

764
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,680
by the attractions of the world

765
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,560
and do not fulfill every desire of your

766
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,520
body because it tempts you to sin.

767
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,060
This you must understand.

768
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,240
So, we will take this

769
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,000
as the main

770
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,500
guiding thought of the mentioned seminar,

771
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,520
"Booklet number 57, the lust of the body

772
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,460
must be sacrificed".

773
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,320
That is absolutely not clear to people.

774
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,280
So, he feels

775
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,180
hunger, because he is

776
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,300
used to it, eats, is not hungry at all, because he doesn't know

777
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,180
what hunger is, what it is for,

778
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,640
what feeding is, what is fed,

779
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,440
what is fed with, has no idea what drives him

780
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,120
who controls him and with what

781
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,420
something, he just stuffs himself.

782
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
These are spiritually dead people.

783
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,120
The living do not do that.

784
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,030
You know.

785
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:44,990
Ok.

786
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,190
Do not allow yourself to be

787
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,970
tempted by the attractions of the world

788
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,050
and do not fulfill every desire of your

789
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,970
body, because it tempts you to sin.

790
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,010
Stay pure

791
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,970
and remember that

792
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,050
you cannot stand before My

793
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,890
eyes if you fall

794
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,670
into sin and do not despise it.

795
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,450
So, not only do you move away, you despise.

796
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,270
You despise.

797
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,670
Do you understand?

798
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,430
You despise.

799
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,790
That means

800
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:14,810
when you see someone

801
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,550
committing sin, you despise the sin.

802
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,790
You know.

803
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,470
Not the person. He is miserable.

804
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,790
He needs help. The sin. You despise.

805
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,490
That's like, you know, I don't want to

806
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,210
see you, I have nothing to do with you.

807
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,650
I want to destroy you.

808
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,710
I am working on making you disappear.

809
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,750
That is, I despise.

810
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,350
And if that is not your attitude, that is because

811
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,430
you still love sin.

812
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,130
And watch,

813
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,310
stay pure

814
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,670
and remember

815
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,430
that you cannot stand before My eyes

816
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,850
if you fall into sin

817
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,470
and do not despise it.

818
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,150
So, this is very,

819
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,690
very important instruction.

820
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,910
Free yourself

821
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,290
from Satan

822
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,470
who tempts you

823
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,090
if you do not resist him.

824
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,990
How? Well, now I will explain.

825
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,290
Sin has great

826
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,270
power over you

827
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,590
and that is why you should

828
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,450
beware of it because by that

829
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,490
you surrender to my opponent

830
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,350
and you distance yourself

831
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,550
from Me, and that for you

832
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,550
means eternal ruin.

833
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,190
So, the purpose of this

834
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,230
Revelation is

835
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,490
to warn us about the danger

836
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,590
of sin. To show

837
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,290
us under whose power we fall

838
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,950
if

839
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,910
we succumb to sin, to lust,

840
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,150
we indulge the body and where will

841
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,370
bring us to that.

842
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,830
And calls us to

843
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,050
resist. And you would

844
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,910
do well if you took this seriously

845
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,290
because because of this the world is corrupted

846
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,590
and that's why it will perish.

847
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,910
Because of lust.

848
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,770
In the Name of Jesus.

849
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,270
It means perverted

850
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,010
lust, wrong

851
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,430
lust.

852
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,330
In the Name of Jesus.

853
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,070
Those are

854
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,990
almost all the lusts that people know.

855
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,490
In the Name of Jesus.
